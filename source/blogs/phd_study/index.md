Due to COVID-19, I have time to stop and think about what I should pursue in the next five years. <!-- more -->I am lucky that can join one startup company (Clobotics Global), which force on use computer vision to provide end-end AI solution for global consumer goods companies. During two years of working in Clobotics Global, I was very honored to collaborate with excellent engineers and scientists to solve many real-life challenging problems. I had lots of great chances that could use what I learn from before to implement many ideas. I was lucky that I could be mentored by many excellent industry leaders. Here, I want to thank Dr. Yipeng Li, Dr. Feng Zhu, Dr. Albert Chen, and Dr. Yan Ke. 

At the same time, I feel there are still have a long way to go to let more and more AI-related products to walk into people's life. For example, 1)related infrastructure development for AI-related products, 2)computation cost for model serving/training, 3)labeling cost for a supervised learning task, 4)uncertainty in the deep learning-based model for challenging computer vision tasks, 5)and more advanced and challenging real-life computer vision tasks. 

In the next decade, I believe people's lifestyles will become more and more intelligent. Lots of great companies like Intel, Nvidia, and AMD are putting lots of sources on the research to provide more powerful and high-performance computing hardware. Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft are putting lots of sources on the research to provide more high-efficiency, convenient, and robust service. However, It is not enough and only a beginning, there are lots of problems that need a more effective way to solve it. Therefore, that is the reason why I want to back to the academy, dive deep,  and generate a more great idea to solve those real-life challenging problems. 

I plan to conduct research in the following reaches area:

1. **Algorithm optimization in computer vision**: Could we provide a more robust model in many other tasks such as Fast R-CNN in object detection? For example, there are many challenging subtasks in five main computer vision tasks (image classification, object detection, target tracking, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation) that need a more robust model to provide better performance. 


2. **Learning method in computer vision**: How could let machine study like people? Currently, people still use supervised learning as main training method for five main computer vision tasks in the industry. This training method requires tons of labeled data which cause extremely high cost for company operation. Is there exist a better way to do it? For example, “self-supervised learning” that would demonstrate more powerful compare with bringing humans into the loop for facilitating bias discovery in image datasets

3. **Advanced data in computer vision**: Some challenging computer vision tasks may not solve by current popular technology. For example, base on 2D image data, how could let the machine confidently identify 16.9 fl oz Coca-Cola Soda with 12 fl oz Coca-Cola Soda from different perspectives? Therefore, I believe that we could involve 3D image data to solve those tricky problems.
