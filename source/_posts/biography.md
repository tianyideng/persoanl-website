Weikun Han is currently working as a research assistant for Dr. Fuxin Li on 3D Point Cloud algorithms.

Weikun Han was a computer vision scientist at Clobotics where he worked on multiple computer vision tasks (image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation). Beside modeling to many real-life challenging problems, he as machine learning engineer to work on many machine learning system design tasks (ceiling analysis dashboard, active learning pipeline, image retrieval system, distributed data pipeline, online learning pipeline), and he as software development engineer to work on many infrastructure development tasks (product search website, data operations platform).

Weikun Han received an M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from UCLA, supervised by Prof. Lei He. He received a B.S. degree in electrical engineering from ISU, supervised by Prof. Liang Dong. He also received the IEEE NANO best student paper award, and he co-authored 5 publications in major journals and conferences during the undergraduate research study.
